### Alcohol Consumption and Mortality

**Project Description:**

Our group analyzed mortality rates by state and compared them with the alcohol consumption volume per person in states for several different causes of death.



**Questions:**

* Is there a correlation between ethanol consumption and various mortality rates?
* Correlation between average alcohol consumption and mortality rate?
* Correlation over the corresponding years of data?



**Data Sources:**

Consumption of alcohol per capita in each of 50 states + DC from 1970 - 2019 [[National Institute of Health]](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance117/pcyr1970-2019.txt)

Mortality rates by state and county for 21 categories in 8 different years from 1980 - 2014 [[Journal of American Medical Association (via Kaggle)]](https://www.kaggle.com/IHME/us-countylevel-mortality)

**ANOVA Test of Ethanol Consumption by Year**
![ANOVA](Images/screenshot_ANOVA.png)

The change in ethanol consumption is significant from year to year.

Correlation of alcohol consumption and mortality types

* Strongest positive correlation = Cirrhosis

* Strongest negative correlation = Diabetes and Cardiovascular

Heatmap Example for Mortality Type Mental/Substance Use
![heatmap](Images/heatmap.png)
*  This shows an increase in mental and substance abuse mortality over time

*  The mortality rate is higher in states such as Alaska, New Mexico, and West Virginia than compared to the rest of the country

**Conclusions:**

* General correlation over all years is weaker than individual years
* Moderate positive correlation for several mortality categories
* Correlations between ethanol consumption and mortality rates associated with cirrhosis and mental/substance use moderate over multiple years
* Ethanol consumption in the US has changed over the years analyzed - curious drop in consumption from 1980 to 1995
* Negative correlations between ethanol consumption and mortality rates associated with cardio and diabetes
